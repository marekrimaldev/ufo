# UFO Fishing

UFO Fishing is a game I made for a weekend game jam. The theme was UFO and participating developers had to incorporate a special object which was a fish.
In the game, you are a servant of an alien king who loves fish. You are sent to Earth to bring him some. The king is very hungry, so he only gives you 60 seconds. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by catching fish using your laser pull. Each fish has a corresponding point score according to the king's taste.
